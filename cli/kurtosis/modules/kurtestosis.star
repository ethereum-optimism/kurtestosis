# This module contains kurtestosis starlark runtime

# Executes a test function referenced by fn_name from module mod
# 
# The purpose of this helper function is to call the before and after hooks
# which get passed the starlark thread that is running the test
# 
# This is crucial for starlarktest go module (and its assert starlark module)
# since it requires a test reporter to be set on the thread that runs the test.
